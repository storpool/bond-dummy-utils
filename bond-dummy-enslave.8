.Dt BOND-DUMMY-ENSLAVE 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bond-dummy-enslave
.Nd add a dummy interface to a bond one when the latter is ready
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar bond-ifname dummy-ifname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility makes sure that a dummy network interface is added to
a bond interface at the correct time; namely, after the initial setup of
the bond interface has been completed.
The
.Nm
utility is not meant to be started directly; it should be invoked from
the dummy interface's
.Va pre-up
command as defined in the
.Xr interfaces 5
configuration file.
Thus, it will be automatically invoked by the
.Xr ifup 8
tool as part of the system startup sequence or, later, if the dummy
interface should be brought up (again) for any reason.
The system administrator must make sure that the
.Xr interfaces 5
file contains an invocation of the
.Nm
utility with the names of the bond interface and the dummy one as
its first and second argument respectively.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The operation of the
.Nm
utility is not directly influenced by any environment variables.
.Sh FILES
The
.Nm
utility waits for the bond interface to be configured by periodically
polling for the existence of the
.Pa /run/network/ifenslave.<ifname>
marker file.
.Sh EXAMPLES
A line similar to the following should be part of the configuration of
the dummy interface in the
.Xr interfaces 5
file:
.Pp
.Dl pre-up bond-dummy-enslave bond0 dummy0
.Pp
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Ex -std
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr interfaces 5 ,
.Xr ifup 8
.Sh STANDARDS
No standards were harmed during the production of the
.Nm
utility.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility was written as part of the
.Tn StorPool
distributed storage software in 2018.
